# Optional: semesters to ENHANCE in the integration step.
# Priority/semantics:
#  - If ENHANCE_TERMS is set to the literal value "all" (case-insensitive), integration will enhance every available
#    grade semester (files in in/grades named like grades_25s.csv).
#  - Else if ENHANCE_TERMS is set to a comma-separated list (e.g. "25s,24f"), integration will enhance exactly those.
#  - Else if ENHANCE_TERMS is not set, CLASS_TERMS will be used as the default list for enhancement.
#  - If neither ENHANCE_TERMS nor CLASS_TERMS are set, integration will enhance all available grade semesters.
# NOTE: ENHANCE_TERMS is only needed when you want to enhance semesters different from CLASS_TERMS.
# ENHANCE_TERMS=25s               # Example: "25s" or "24f,25s"
# ENHANCE_TERMS=all               # Enhance every available semester
